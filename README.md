Adventure Works Report
A business report using CSV data files including customer, sales, and product data; which has been synthesised and visualised using Power BI.

Project Overview:
This project is about a retail bike company that sells various types of products and performs a deep dive into their sales analytics, revenue forecasts and trends in customer behaviour.

Business Problem:
The business is looking through their data and wants to see where they perform best, in terms of location and products, and also how they are projected to perform in the future.
This analysis is important because it satisfies these demands, while offering further insight into the data at hand. The project supports decisions related: to which customers (and customer subgroups) purchase the goods the most, where purchases are coming from and the share of purchases from each location, product performance and how much revenue they generate for the company, as well as how each of these affect the other.

Project Objectives:
Identify the highest spending customers
Understand customer demographics affecting spending
Locate which area garners the most customer revenue
Decipher return rates and factors surrounding them
Identify the highest-selling products
Compare the monthly figures to the target numbers
Forecast company performance
Display and assess company KPIs

Data Sources:
Public dataset of unstructured sales, returns, customer data and more
